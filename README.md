# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I made the first attempt at dabbling into sqlalchemy, which could figure out why this is a powerful toolkit. It is great to be able to take advantage of its ability to manipulate date and time. That said, it allowed me to figure out the precipitation and temperature of a whole year.
